Turtle Drawing and Racing Games

Welcome to the **Turtle Drawing and Racing Games** repository! This project showcases two interactive Python applications using the Turtle graphics module. Both are beginner-friendly and fun for exploring basic programming concepts.

Project 1: Draw_with_Turtle
Description:
Control a turtle using your keyboard to draw shapes and lines on the screen.

Bet on which turtle will win the race! Six turtles compete, and you can place your bet on one.

Features:
- **Randomized race**: Each turtle's movement is randomized to keep it exciting.
- **User input**: Enter your bet for a chance to guess the winning turtle.

How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `Turtle_race.py` file.
3. Input your bet and watch the race!
